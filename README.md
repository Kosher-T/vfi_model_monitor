## The Architecture
*"Models degrade. Good systems heal themselves."*

This project implements an **end-to-end MLOps Drift Detection System** for a Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) model. Instead of manually checking for performance decay (**fondly named "wobbly chairs"**) or data quality issues (**"softwood"**), this system automates the entire **Quality Control loop** using **Containerized Microservices** and **CI/CD Orchestration**.

## Project Status: The Simulation
To test this system properly, I am currently running it in a controlled, **simulated environment**. This allows me to prove that the "safety net" works before trusting it with a live model.

| Component | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Model** | 🔹 **Simulated** | My actual VFI model is currently still in training. For now, I am using a "mock" (a stand-in) to ensure the monitoring system triggers correctly, regardless of the specific model inside. |
| **Data Source** | 🔹 **Synthetic** | I created specific test data to "force" the system to react. By feeding it intentionally perfect or intentionally bad data, I can guarantee that the system correctly spots the difference between a **PASS** and a **FAIL**. |
| **Scalability** | 🔹 **Modular Design** | Currently, this detects drift in **Video** inputs. However, the system is built like building blocks. In the future, I can easily "snap in" new blocks for Audio or Text models without breaking the existing structure. |

## Tech Stack & Design Patterns

| Component | Tech | Role (The Factory Analogy) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drift Detection** | TensorFlow / **MobileNetV2** | The QC Sensor: Uses Transfer Learning to extract feature **embeddings** from video frames (The "Touch Test"). |
| **Statistical Analysis** | SciPy (**KS Test**) | The Judge: Compares production data against a known "**Golden Baseline**" to quantify distribution shift. |
| **Infrastructure** | **Docker** | The QC Booth: A portable, isolated environment that ensures the monitor runs identically on any machine. |
| **Orchestration** | **GitHub Actions** | The Manager: Automates the schedule, manages the container lifecycle, and handles the "**Red Phone**" logic. |

## The Workflow

### 1. The "Saboteur" (Data Simulation)
To prove the system works, I built a `data_saboteur.py` script that synthetically generates **"drifted" data** (noise, blur, low-light) to simulate real-world camera failures.

### 2. The "Endpoint" (Modular Monitoring)
The monitoring logic is decoupled from the orchestration.

* It runs as a **stateless Docker Container**.
* It accepts a volume of data and a baseline reference.
* It outputs a strictly typed status (`PASS`/`FAIL`) and a **Drift Score**.

> **Why this matters:** This architecture is **model-agnostic**. I can swap the internal logic for an NLP monitor, and the infrastructure remains unchanged.

### 3. The "Red Phone" (Automated Retraining)
When drift is detected (*p-value* < 0.05), the system doesn't just alert—it acts. The primary workflow automatically triggers a secondary **Retraining Pipeline** via the GitHub CLI, simulating a **continuous training (CT) loop**.

## How to Run This Project

**Prerequisites:**

* Docker installed
* Python 3.9+

### 1. Build the Monitor:
```bash
docker build -t vfi-monitor .
```

### 2. Run the Saboteur (Create Bad Data):
```bash
python data_saboteur.py
```

### 3. Run the QC Check Manually:
```bash
docker run \
  -v $(pwd)/data/drifted_frames:/app/incoming_data \
  -v $(pwd)/temp_status:/app/status_output \
  vfi-monitor
```

## Future Improvements & Roadmap

### Immediate Refinements (Next 2 Weeks)
* **Configuration Decoupling:** Currently, parameters are hardcoded. I am moving all thresholds (e.g., `Drift Score > 30%`) and file paths into a central `config.yaml` or environment variables. This ensures the codebase is clean, reusable, and production-ready without needing to touch the core logic.
* **Visualization Dashboard:** Connect the **Drift Score** output to a **Grafana** or **Streamlit** dashboard. This will provide a real-time "Pulse Check" of the system, visualizing how the Data Drift fluctuates over time.

### Deep Learning & MLOps Expansions
* **Model Drift (Concept Drift):** The system currently detects **Data Drift** (is the input weird?). The next phase is implementing **Model Decay** detection (is the model making mistakes?). This will involve creating a feedback loop to compare predictions against ground truth labels.
* **Horizontal Scaling (Model Agnosticism):** Once the VFI pipeline is perfected, I will generalize the architecture. The goal is to either create and train models or pull them directly from **Hugging Face** or **Kaggle**, wrap them in this standard container, and monitor them using the same Sentinel logic.
* **A/B Testing:** Implement a **Canary Deployment** strategy, allowing the "Champion" model and the "Challenger" model to run side-by-side on live data to compare performance safely.
